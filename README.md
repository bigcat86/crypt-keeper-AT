## Description

Crypt Keeper is an intuitive, full-stack web application designed to simplify cryptocurrency portfolio management. 
- Our Goal was to create a Dashboard application that would help users manage their portfolio when it comes to their Cryptocurrencies. Our focus was to be able to keep track of buying and selling with the ability to also get updated information on their portfolios.
- As a User I want to be able to add crypto that I have and be able to manage the value and quantity I have. After that, I want to be able to remove the crypto I sell so I can keep track of what I have on my portfolio.
